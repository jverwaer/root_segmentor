# Root Segmentor

Root segmentor simplifies the segmentation and analysis of root images. It relies on a pixel classifier and some post-processing.

* The file `root_segementor_VIB.py` contains several functions that facilitate automated root segmentation.
* The file `processing_scripts/tutorial.ipynb` is a Python Notebook file that illustrates how to use these functions.
* The folder `models/` contains a set of pretrained classifiers
